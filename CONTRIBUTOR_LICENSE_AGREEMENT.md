## Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute their contributions and such derivative works.

## Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the work to which such contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that their contribution, or the work to which the contribution was submitted, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that contribution or work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## Contributor Representations

Each Contributor represents that the contribution(s) they are submitting is their original creation(s) and they have the right to submit the contribution(s). Each Contributor agrees to notify You of any facts or circumstances of which they become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## You are not required to accept this Agreement, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants You permission to use, modify, and distribute the contributions and its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this Agreement. Therefore, by submitting a contribution, the Contributor agrees to be bound by these terms.
