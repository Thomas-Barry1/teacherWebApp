    <h2>Why Choose TeachGenie?</h2>
    <p>
      We understand the challenges teachers face: Endless hours spent creating
      lesson plans, tests, and quizzes, followed by late nights grading. This
      workload often extends well beyond the classroom, leaving little time for
      personal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      TeachGenie was built to change that. Our mission is to streamline your
      workflow, allowing you to reclaim your evenings and weekends while
      maintaining exceptional standards in the classroom.
